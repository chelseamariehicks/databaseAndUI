A single page application for maintaining workouts with the following functionality:

-Visiting the page will show a table displaying all completed exercises. 
-At the top of the page there is a form to allow user to enter in all the data needed to make a new entry in the table with a button to
submit it. 
-Submitting workout adds a row to the table if it was successfully added to the database. If it was not successfully added (due to user
entry error) it won't be added to the table.  
-Each row has delete and edit row options.
-The form to edit the exercise is pre-populated with the existing data from that row.

All interactions, other than updating an exercise, happen via Ajax using Ajax calls to GET or POST to the server.
